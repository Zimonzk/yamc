Since yamc is intended to support extremely large worlds there needs to be a
system to have acurate positions independent of the position on the world.
To gurantee this the typical "world coordinates" usen in opengl are not actual
coordinates refering to the absolute position in the world. Instead they are called
"rrpos" (Rendering Relative POSition) and are relative to the originof the
chunk in which the player currently is. These of cours need to be updated when the
player changes chunk.
Still ther needs to be a way to refer to an absolute position in the world.
This is done using "longpos" (LONG POSiton) or short (to use in variable
names) "lpos" coordinates, which consist of an "rpos" (Relative POSition)
element, similar to the rrpos coordinates and a "chunk" element which refers
to the chunks X and Z coordinates with the type long.
Tehr rpos now means the position relative th the chunks origin which is
specified in chunk.
The "chunk coordinates" in chunk are long integers where a step of 1 means one
chunk more so to calculate the number of blocks it must be muiltiplied with
the number of blocks alng a side of a chunk specified in the constant
"CHUNK_LIM_HOR".
